# ML-using-TenSEAL
From tutorials in OpenMined, we try to extend the definitions for ML models like logistic regression, Neural Networks, Decision Tree*, XGBoost* and obtain insights from architecture point of view. The resources utilized before and after training the model on encrypted data are compared and analyzed.
